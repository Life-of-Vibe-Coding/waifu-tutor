### 1. When to use
Trigger scenarios include: user asking to write an essay, draft an essay, or get help with an essay on a topic; user wanting a structured essay (intro, body paragraphs, conclusion) with a chosen number of body paragraphs; and other skills (e.g. exam-mode-tuner) needing structured long-form writing.

### 2. How to use
1. Clarify topic, number of body paragraphs (or use a default), audience, stance, length, and style with the user if needed.
2. Call the outline-builder subskill with body_count = N to produce a thesis and (N+2)-part outline (intro, N body points, conclusion).
3. Call the paragraph-generator subskill for the introduction, then each of the N body paragraphs, then the conclusion.
4. Assemble the (N+2) paragraphs and present the full essay; optionally suggest one revision.
5. Support revision by re-generating only the paragraphs that need changes.

### 3. Why to use
It gives users a clear, repeatable structure for essays with a flexible number of body paragraphs, and produces a complete draft from a topic or prompt with coherent thesis and body logic.

### 4. Key features
Configurable number of body paragraphs (no hardcoded count), audience, stance, length, and style; thesis-driven outline; role-specific paragraph generation (intro/body/conclusion); optional source-based writing; revision of individual paragraphs; and links to writing-coach and exam-mode-tuner for deeper feedback or timed practice.
