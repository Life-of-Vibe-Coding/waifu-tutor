### 1. When to use
Trigger scenarios include: users request study outlines, plans or review plans; need systematic knowledge structure for a topic/subject; are overwhelmed by course materials and don't know where to start; need to extract key exam review content before tests; have uploaded multiple learning materials and need a holistic overview; other skills recommend clarifying knowledge foundations first.

### 2. How to use
1. Confirm user's learning scope, profile (learning stage, prior knowledge, goals)
2. Call sub-skills to extract knowledge structure, map concept dependencies and generate learning path
3. Build multi-level layered study outline
4. Classify learning priorities and formulate targeted review strategies
5. Allocate study time and make timed plans if users provide time budget or exam date
6. Output structured Markdown study guide and provide 2-3 follow-up action suggestions

### 3. Why to use
It solves the problem of messy learning materials, unclear knowledge context, and lack of systematic review plans, helping users quickly sort out the overall knowledge framework, clarify learning priorities, and arrange reasonable review progress to improve learning efficiency.

### 4. Key features
1. Supports both document-based and free-topic learning guide creation
2. Adopts standardized knowledge extraction, dependency mapping and time allocation processes
3. Classifies content by difficulty and learning priority, formulates targeted learning strategies
4. Supports custom depth, time budget and learning goals
5. Links with multiple auxiliary learning skills for follow-up practices like quizzes, flashcards, project-based learning
6. Has clear boundary handling for edge cases such as too-short materials, overly broad topics and tight study time
