### 1. When to use
Trigger scenarios include: user requesting practice exams/quizzes; users needing timed exam simulation with instant feedback; post-module mastery checks; users wanting to verify learning or practice hard questions; and being called by other skills like study-guide-creator, memory-comprehension-coach, project-based-tutor for diagnostic quizzes, spaced review and milestone mastery verification.

### 2. How to use
1.  Set exam parameters: confirm scope (document/topic/skill-passed content), default or customize question count, type mix, time limit, difficulty and feedback mode.
2.  Call the question-generation subskill to generate Bloom-level distributed, quality-qualified questions covering core concepts.
3.  Run exam flow: support immediate per-question feedback + adaptive difficulty adjustment, or batch exam mode with timed reminders.
4.  Grade objectively or subjectively per rubrics.
5.  Adjust question difficulty in real time via the adaptive-difficulty subskill.
6.  Generate post-exam performance reports via performance-analytics, then recommend targeted follow-up actions linked to other skills based on user's score and weak points.

### 3. Why to use
It helps users simulate real exam scenarios, test learning mastery, identify knowledge gaps and weak concepts, and get targeted learning guidance to improve learning efficiency and exam readiness.

### 4. Key features
Supports custom and adaptive difficulty, multiple question types and Bloom level distribution, timed exam reminders, immediate or batch feedback, automatic and rubric-based grading, progress saving for mid-exam exits, and anti-repeat question logic. It also has clear boundary handling for thin learning materials, subjective grading disputes and repeated test sessions.
